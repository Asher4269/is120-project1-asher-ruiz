        <h2>Learn More: Emergency Funds</h2>
        <h3>What is an Emergency Fund?</h3>
        <p>Description of Emergency Fund.</p>
        <h3>How much should one save?</h3>
        <p>Here is how much one should save.</p>
        <h3>Where do I store the money?</h3>
        <p>Money Market is probably fine.</p>
        <h3>When do I use the money?</h3>
        <p>Hospital visits, job loss, etc.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="lr-investments">
        <h2>Learn More: Investments</h2>
        <h3>Stocks</h3>
        <p>Bro go buy some stocks, # Buy High Sell Low</p>
        <h3>Index Funds</h3>
        <p>These are the best stocks to buy if you want to have safe growth.</p>
        <h3>Mutual Funds</h3>
        <p>
          Basically super duper big company buys a bunch of stocks for you and
          charges a small fee.
        </p>

      <section id="lr-retirement">
        <h2>Learn More: Retirement</h2>
        <h3>What is a retirement?</h3>
        <p>
          Anything referring to retirement are accounts that hold onto assets
          until a certain age (usually 65). Think of investments like coins and
          retirement accounts like pockets. We can put coins in our pockets, but
          the coins are the value. However, we are not allowed to put our hand
          in our pocket until retirement age. There are loopholes, but this is
          the majority of the case. So, within a retirement account, one chooses
          their investments and waits til' they grow old!
        </p>
        <h3>Traditional vs. Roth</h3>
        <p>
          This is a tax difference: tax-deductible vs. tax-free. Traditional
          means that you can deduct it from your Adjusted Growth Income so you
          don't have to pay as many taxes this year. Roth means that while you
          cannot deduct it this year, you will be able to pull the money out at
          retirement age and not pay taxes on any of it.
        </p>
        <h3>Individual vs. 401k</h3>
        <p>
          You can have both accounts (it is smart to). Individual are personal
          retirement accounts, while 401k are offered through jobs. You are
          legally allowed to contribute a lot more to a 401k, and jobs tend to
          match some of it. There are lots of limits on personal retirement
          accounts.
        </p>
        <h3>529</h3>
        <p>
          While not a retirement account, 529 act as growth accounts for your
          children. Once they reach college age, the money can go towards
          tuition, food, housing, equipment, books, electronics, etc. Pretty
          nifty way to set your kids up for life. The contribution limits on
          these are also very high.

      <section id="lr-taxes">
        <h2>Learn More: Taxes</h2>
        <h3>What are taxes?</h3>
        <p>
          Taxes are anything we pay to a state entity. They vary based on why we
          pay that specific tax.
        </p>
        <h3>Income Tax</h3>
        <p>
          These are broken down into Federal, State, Medicaid, and Social
          Security expenses. Medicaid and Social Security are usually flat rates
          while federal and state are bracketed (state to state varies). These
          can even vary down to the zipcode.
        </p>
        <h3>Sales Tax</h3>
        <p>
          We get taxed on what we buy. The seller usually shares some of this
          burden as well. This is why something at the store is not 19.99 for
          real. It's usually a bit more.
        </p>
        <h3>Estate Tax</h3>
        <p>
          Gifts are taxed usually when they are above the sum of $10,000. It
          doesn't matter how you get it (cash, land, vehicle, stocks, etc.), you
          have to pay a percentage of it to the government. I know! Lame!
        </p>
        <h3>Tax Planning</h3>
        <p>
          This is the strategic planning of tax avoidance (don't confuse that
          with tax evasion). There are deductions and credits or loopholes in
          estate planning in order to avoid certain tax claims. One can learn
          these or get a great accountant!
        </p>

      <section id="lr-debt">
        <h2>Learn More: Debt</h2>
        <h3>Mortgage</h3>
        <p>
          In this housing market, you don't need to know this definition. Stick
          to renting lol.
        </p>
        <h3>Auto</h3>
        <p>
          Don't do this. Just don't. It is never worth it. You are taking out a
          loan against an asset that depreciates faster than most olympic
          sprinters. Just buy a piece of junk that beats walking until you can
          pay in full for something else.
        </p>
        <h3>Credit</h3>
        <p>
          If you have credit card debt, don't have a credit card! Use an
          emergency fund for emergencies, not credit cards. This is the quickest
          path to broke for life.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="lr-credit-score">
        <h2>Learn More: Credit Score</h2>
        <h3>What is a credit score?</h3>
        <p>
          This is how lenders see how responsible you are. It's a score that
          ranges from 300 to 850. Ideally you should be at 750 or above.
        </p>
        <h3>How am I scored?</h3>
        <p>
          Certain factors are weighted and assigned to your final score. For
          example, late payments tank your score. Also, the length of your
          history with lenders betters your score. I will create a better
          explanation for this down the line. For now, just pay all of your debt
          on time and don't go opening too many accounts at once.
