# IS 120: Project 1

# Description:

### Initial Ideas:

This is my beloved personal finance project. For the longest time, I have made personal budgets in excel that have always varied. I decided I wanted to make one website that is so simple that budgets and personal finance can become accessible to all. While I only intended to make a simply budget app, my interests quickly expanded to making custom finance calculators (something I might do later in this class), a learn more page, and a transaction css card page for custom excel spreadsheets.

### Design and Layout:

For this project, I really wanted to zoom in on utilizing icons as navigation for the user. I wanted to go for a hyper simplistic look, making navigation as easy as possible for the user. I utilized principles of CRUD to the best of my abilities, by combining and spreading apart boxes/divs based on where I thought they belonged, while adding contrast where appealing. I loved diving deep into :hover especially in this project. I thought it added a lot of animations that helped my pages get 1 step closer to looking professional.
I also discovered gradients which were super fun to play around with. They made my page just a bit more snazzy.

# What I learned:

### Problems I ran into:

1. Icons were tough to make appealing. I often had to search out images where they had transparent backgrounds, which limited my pool of possible icons. In the future, I would like to learn a small bit of graphic design to overcome this hump (I imagine that a lot of web designers need some of this anyways).
2. Positioning and Responsiveness felt finnicky this time around. I constantly found myself adjusting and tweaking until I engineered a div or an image just right so that it would be responsive. I feel like there has to be better ways to position things than the way I did it. I aim to keep learning about this and growing in a way that allows myself as a developer to position gracefully and speedily in the future.
   I even tried display: flex; but it ended up being so complicated that I dropped it and settled for position: absolutes in a lot of areas. I recognize this if I hone in on this area of web development, I will improve a lot faster.
3. The lack of javascript also felt like a big wall. There were deeper things I wanted to do such as a budget page and finance calculators that will have to wait until further on the semester. I also hope to teach myself javascript to at least build out a shallow front-end (something that can hold onto data but nothing as robust as a database, that would be down the road).
4. Text and Color were also a big gap in my design I feel. I am not the most artistic, so figuring out design and beauty within my web-page pushed me outside of my comfort zone. I would love to study up more on this.

### How Project Evolved:

1. Initially, I just wanted the page to be a simple budget calculator. The requirements given in the instructions inspired me to make pages I think users would want to see.
2. It inspired me to play around more with css cards and buttons for purchase (they currently do not do anything, but it's cool to think that one day they might).
3. In thinking about UI, I was inspired to make a cool gimmick on my index page where my link icons displayed text on hover. It took a youtube video or two, but I ended up figuring out something that looks sleek.
4. I now have the goal to further my study of javascript so I can make a real, simple web app!
